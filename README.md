# clustTools
Comprehensive dimensionality reduction and cluster analysis toolset

The _clustTools_ package provides a medley of functions used for seemless integration of various dimensionality reduction methods (multi-dimensional scaling/MDS, principal component analysis/PCA, uniform manifold approximation and projection/UMAP or factor analysis/FA), clustering (hierarchical clustering, K-means, PAM and density DBSCAN clustering) and self-orgnizing map (SOM) analyses. In addition, a set of functions is provided for visualization, quality control and cross-validation of the clustering and reduction analysis results.

For optimal performance of the SOM tools, please install the _somKernels_ package (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/somKernels), which provides additional distance measures.
